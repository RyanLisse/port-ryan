## I wanted to have a solid foundation in the world of coding and build beautiful websites and apps as a career!
Part of it is imposter syndrome, but I really feel this is helping me lay down a good foundation as a Developer.
Being self-taught and not getting hired anywhere started to affect my confidence.

In this first course, I learned how to distinguish between front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.
Although tailwind CSS is still my go to CSS framework I now have a deeper understanding benefits of working with UI frameworks like bootstrap or material UI.
Once you complete the program, i'll get exclusive access to the Meta Career Programs Job Board—a job search platform that connects you with 200+ employers who have committed to sourcing talent through Meta’s certificate programs, as well as career support resources to help me with my job search.

So I'm working on getting certified by Meta as a front-end developer first and after that I will focus on the back-end and mobile side of the program.
While i'm finishing the course, I will be specializing in all things blockchain and web3.
Next steps learning in public, feeling inspired.
This is course 1 of 9 for the front-end, already finished the next one.
