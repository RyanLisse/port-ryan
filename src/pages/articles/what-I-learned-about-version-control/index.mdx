## So what is version control? 
version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can access specific versions later. In software development, Version Control Systems (VCS) allows developers to manage changes to their code and track who made each change.
Honestly I only knew of Github and Gitlab because the CEO is a dutch developer/Entrepreneur(lookup Sid Sijbrandij if it peaked your interest).



In the course you learn how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other's code.
Learning basic devops and agile methodologies.
Understanding the differences between centralized and distributed version control systems or DVCS = Distributed Version control system
CVCS = Centralised Version Control System. 
Reminded me of blockchain hmmm….

We looked at different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow.
Having different development Environments going from staging to testing to production so that prior to releasing new features or changes you need to verify that the code you release is not going to cause any issues or bugs.


After that I got introduced to some of the most commonly used Linux commands that you can use to work with files on your hard drive and create powerful workflows that will automate your work, saving time and effort. 
Finally, we learned how Git can be used in software development projects to manage team files. 

I really learned a lot, didn’t expect a subject as version control to be fun.
So another one bites the dust, collecting certs like NFT’s.
Next up is an in depth course on HTML and CSS, 4 down 5 courses to go……
