## Javascript is the language of the web!
One of the basic principles of programming can be summed with the acronym DRY in other words don't repeat yourself.
DON'T
REPEAT
YOURSELF

JavaScript adds interactivity to the front-end, or client-side, of a webpage.
Browsers speak javascript
Jquery is considered legacy code and was used as a solution to be compatible with all browsers.
Mastering vanilla JS is a must to get the most out of frameworks and libraries built on top of it.
Don’t use var use const and let instead.

In JavaScript, there is also a shorthand version of writing a conditional statement, known as the conditional (ternary) operator:
 working with the Object, Array, Map, and Set data structures.
## Understanding the differences between Object orientated programming and functional Programming.
In functional programming, data and functions that operate on it are clearly separated, not combined inside objects.

And in Object Orientated Programming -> OOP Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects, where each object represents some particular aspect of the system.
Test-Driven Development, by writing unit tests using Jest.
This course covers a wide range of subjects and I believe it’s given me a good foundation to keep exploring.
